    <h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
    <!-- <p>Give a high-level overview of what you implemented in this project. Think about what you've built as a whole. Share your thoughts on what interesting things you've learned from completing the project.</p> -->
	<!-- <br> -->
	<p>
		This project was about implementing physics/rendering for non-rigid cloth-like geometries. In order to simulate cloth, we represent it as a mesh of vertices, where each vertex was coupled with its neighbors with spring forces representative of structural, shearing, and bending constraints. Using verlet integration, we simulate the evolution of the cloth given its position and the forces acting upon each of its vertices. By simulating successive timesteps we can create a full simulation of the cloth.
		<br><br>
		In order to implement collisions, we check if the vertices of the cloth are not where they're supposed to be (say, inside a sphere), and adjust them every time step such that they can't move through solid objects. Self-collisions can be handled similarly. We can check that each vertex is not too close to another vertex, and adjust its position to be farther apart. However this would take $O(n^2)$ time, so we implement the same algorithm except we store the location of the vertices in a hashmap every step such that when we want to check what vertices are near a given vertex, we only need to check the vertices that share the same hash. With collisions handled, our cloth can stretch, fold and rub against any sphere or plane we create in the scene.
		<br><br>
		Now with functional physics, we want to efficiently render the animation. Using parallelizeable shader programs we can apply textures, blinn-phong shading, and height mapping. The latter can be accomplished with visual bump mapping, or with mesh-altering displacement mapping.
		<br><br>
		Some of the problems we faced were implementing and designing the hash map for self collisions, and getting used to the shader coding format. The former we figured out by talking with each other, and the latter just took some practice along with trial and error. We had some spectacular bugs with the self collision where the cloth would implode or suddenly gain rapid momentum due to an error with the normalization of the correction vectors, but nothing that a little searching couldn't fix.

  </a>
    <blockquote><b>
      Experiment with some the parameters in the simulation. 
      To do so, pause the simulation at the start with <kbd>P</kbd>, modify the values of interest, and then resume by pressing <kbd>P</kbd> again. 
      You can also restart the simulation at any time from the cloth's starting position by pressing <kbd>R</kbd>.
      <br />
      <small>
      Describe the effects of changing the spring constant <code>ks</code>; how does the cloth behave from start to rest with a very low <code>ks</code>? 
      A high <code>ks</code>?
      </small>
    </b></blockquote>

    <p>
		<code>ks</code> affects how strong the constraint forces are. Thus they affect how much the cloth stays rigid, and how much resistance it puts up to bending and shearing.
		<br>
		At low <code>ks</code>, the cloth seems more liquid-like because the solid constraints are weak.
		<br>
		Similarly, at high <code>ks</code>, the cloth is much more stiff and resists bending and folding.
    </p>


    <blockquote><b>
      <small>
        What about for <code>density</code>?
      </small>
    </b></blockquote>

    <p>
		Density effects the mass of every mass point, and since $\frac{F}{m}=a$, the effect of changing the density has the inverse effect of changing the spring constant. Thus if you change the ks and density by the same factor, it would lead to the same simulation. If density is changed without altering the spring constant, we would get effects similar to the ones shown above for the spring constant; low density would get the effects of high ks, and vice versa.
    </p>
    
    
    <blockquote><b>
      <small>
        What about for <code>damping</code>?
      </small>
    </b></blockquote>

    <p>
		Damping affects how quickly energy leaves the system. Thus high damping basically just slows down the animation, and there are no oscillations, while low damping introduces oscillations as the cloth begins to bounce around the resting position until it settles down (if damping != 0). The low damping image shows how far the cloth will oscillate around the resting position, as well as its chaotic position, while the high damping image shows how stably the cloth falls (it doesn't oscillate). There are very little ripples, and those that do appear disappear quickly.
    </p>

    <p>
      Note that low and high density isn't shown, because their effects on the mesh is the same as high and low ks respectively, so for comparison one can use the same images. That being said, the images were rendered using the ks parameter and were labelled as such.
	  <br>
	  The damping images show how the cloth acts as it falls. Low damping gives the oscillations seen in the ripples of the first image, while high damping slows down the falling, but also stabilizes it.
	  <br>
	  The ks/density images show how both parameters can affect how well the cloth can rigidly hold itself under its own weight.

    <p>
		As described before, ks affects the stiffness of the cloth, or how rigid it is when acted upon by forces. Thus, for lower ks we see the cloth droop very loosely over the sphere, almost like it is stretched over it. At higher ks, the cloth has folds but it is like trying to wrap a ball in wrapping paper. The cloth maintains its structure (little stretching/malformation) and doesn't fold much.

    <p>
		As described before, ks and density affect the $F=ma$ equation inversely to each other, so if we were to scale both by the same constant, then nothing would happen. Thus they are both two sides of the same coin when it comes to affecting behavior of the cloth.
		<br>
		Low ks/high density:
		<br>
		The cloth acts liquid-like as it falls, and as it self-collides it ripples and collapses on itself with little resistance.
		<br>
		High ks/low density:
		<br>
		The cloth acts more like a thick cut of fabric and doesn't deform or ripple under its own weight. When it folds up, it creates larger folds quicker without forming a pile of ripples like the low ks/high density.

    <blockquote><b>
    Explain in your own words what is a shader program and how vertex and fragment shaders work together to create lighting and material effects.
    </b></blockquote>

    <p>
		Shader programs are meant to speed up the rendering of geometries by parallelizing the process. Shader programs are meant to be run independently of one another, on multiple objects in the scene simultaneously, allowing for trivial parallelization.
		<br>
		There are two shader types for our renders: vertex and fragment shaders. Vertex shaders are meant to be run on a single vertex and perform any relevant transforms and modify their normals and positions. They also pass values to the second type of shader, fragments, which operate on the "fragments" between the vertices. Using the attributes determined by the vertex shaders, the fragment can be processed and a color can be assigned to it.		
    </p>

    Explain the Blinn-Phong shading model in your own words. 
    Show a screenshot of your Blinn-Phong shader outputting only the ambient component, a screen shot only outputting the diffuse component, a screen shot only outputting the specular component, and one using the entire Blinn-Phong model.
    </b></blockquote>

    <p>
		The Blinn-Phong model of lighting categorizes lighting effects into three types: ambient, diffuse, and specular. 
		<br><br>
		Ambient light is constant everywhere in the scene even if it is hidden from a light source. 
		<br><br>
		Diffuse lighting takes into account the angle between the light source and the normal of the surface. The amount of diffuse reflected light takes into account the distance from the light source ($1/r^2$), and the angle ($\cos{\theta}$).
		<br><br>
		Specular lighting is a stronger reflection of the light rays that are more mirror-like in nature. The reflected light shares the same $1/r^2$ term, and has an analogous cos theta term that scales based on the angle between the bisector of the viewing/light vectors, and the light vector. This angle term scales the reflection based on what angle we are looking at the reflection compared to the orientation of the reflector. This cosine term is modified with a power term $p$, which determines how "mirror-like" the surface is. High p will create well-defined specular lighting, while low p will have a lot of highlights.

		Compare bump vs displacement mapping in images:
		<br>
		Bump mapping gives the illusion of height differences on the surface by manipulating the normals used for diffusion/specular reflection calculation. The result is an unchanged geometry, but a skin that looks like it has depth. Since the geometry is unchanged, collisions aren't affected and the cloth hangs on the sphere as it normally does.
		<br>
		Displacement mapping modifies the normals on the mesh the same way bump mapping does, but it also changes the geometry by moving the vertices to reflect the height map that the mesh is trying to replicate. The result is similar to that of bump mapping, except the collisions are affected, so the cloth and sphere interact differently. This leads to a lumpy looking cloth, and the silhouette of the sphere and cloth look distinctly different.
		<br><br>
		Compare sphere mesh coarseness:
		Higher sphere resolution had sharper height differences in displacement compared to rougher displacements in coarser resolution, but when the cloth fell on the sphere, it was difficult to discern the two.

  <h2 align="middle">Contributions</h2>
  <p>
    Similar to our last project, we were able to meet up at a library or online a few times and complete most of the code together. Some minor/tedious debugging was done solo at home, and the writeup was done remotely as well, but most of the code was done via pair programming. A major setback is one of us got sick for a week after break leading to more work being done in parallel individually instead of together in the sake of time efficiency.
