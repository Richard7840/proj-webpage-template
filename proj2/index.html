<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
<p>
    In this project we implement several algorithms used to interpolate and upscale a geometry given only discrete points. We also found ways to smooth normal calculations with mesh operations, reducing shading/lighting aliasing. With Bezier curves we can interpolate infinite points between a number of control points in a continuous manner, and calculate them on demand with successive linear interpolations. With mesh operations we can directly upscale the original mesh with more triangles and smooth its surface, giving us a mesh that we can perform other graphic operations on easily.
	<br>
	This project shows how, with a bit of creativity, a complicated high-definition object can be compressed and represented with relatively few control points or triangles, and can be upsampled as needed to converge back to the original object.
</p>
<br>

<h3 align="middle">Part 1: Bezier Curves with 1D de Casteljau Subdivision</h3>


<b>
  Briefly explain de Casteljau's algorithm and how you implemented it in order to evaluate Bezier curves.
</b>
<p>
    De Casteljau's algorithm is a recursive method of defining a curve with a series of n control points and a parameter t that varies from 0 to 1. By successively increasing the granularity of the points between the control points using successive linear interpolations, a progressively more complicated and smooth line can be defined.
	<br>
	Our implementation performs each step of recursion by taking the n control points and reducing them to n-1 control points based on the value of t. This is done by taking every consecutive pair of control points in order (($p_1$,$p_2$), ($p_2$,$p_3$), ... , ($p_{n-1}$,$p_n$)), and linear interpolated the point between them. This is done using the parameter t which determines how much we consider each point with the simple formula $(1-t)p_i + tp_{i+1}$. The rest of the algorithm implemented by the starter code runs this until only a single point remains, which is the point along the curve.

</p>

<h3 align="middle">Part 2: Bezier Surfaces with Separable 1D de Casteljau</h3>
<b>
  Briefly explain how de Casteljau algorithm extends to Bezier surfaces and how you implemented it in order to evaluate Bezier surfaces.
</b>
<p>
    The de Casteljau algorithm extends nicely to Bezier surfaces in 3D. Now we have a nxn 2D array of control points instead of a 1D array, but we can perform the algorithm with n+1 iterations of the 1D algorithm. We first perform the 1D algorithm used in the previous part to find the parameterized point of each row along the 2D array. Now we can run the 1D algorithm once more on the n parameterized points to give us the final parameterized point along the mesh.

<h3 align="middle">Part 3: Area-Weighted Vertex Normals</h3>

<b>
	Briefly explain how you implemented the area-weighted vertex normals.	
</b>
<p>
	We implemented area-weighted vertex normals by traversing each adjacent face to our original vertex to find their vertex positions. With each faces' vertices, two vectors could be created between them, and the cross product of the vectors would be normal to the face and have a magnitude twice the area. Once every adjacent face has been traversed and their normals calculated, they could be summed together and normalized to create an area weighted normal for the original vertex. The factor of two in the cross product won't matter if all of them have it since the result is normalized anyways.

<h3 align="middle">Part 4: Edge Flip</h3>
<b>
  Briefly explain how you implemented the edge flip operation and describe any interesting implementation / debugging tricks you have used.
</b>
<p>
	In order to implement edge flipping, we traverse the adjacent triangles to store all the relevant elements of the two triangles with respect to the edge we want to flip. Then we reassign all the pointers of the halfedges, vertices and faces (edges weren't reassigned due to how we assigned half-edges) to their appropriate half-edge pointers.

<b>
    Write about your eventful debugging journey, if you have experienced one.
</b>
<p>
    Our implementation focused on human readability by naming elements geometrically to match intuition. Coincidentally, this was also a great tool for debugging, which required a bit of experimental edge flipping.
</p>
<br>


<h3 align="middle">Part 5: Edge Split</h3>
<b>
  Briefly explain how you implemented the edge split operation and describe any interesting implementation / debugging tricks you have used.
</b>
<p>
    We implemented edge splits with a similar methodology to edge flipping. We traversed the adjacent triangles to store all the original elements, then defined all the new elements that would be created. Finally, with the help of a diagram all the elements had their pointers reassigned in the same fashion as for edge flipping, except we had to reassign edges as well this time.
	<br>
	The diagram for this part is shown below. Elements marked in blue pen are new:

<h3 align="middle">Part 6: Loop Subdivision for Mesh Upsampling</h3>
<b>
  Briefly explain how you implemented the loop subdivision and describe any interesting implementation / debugging tricks you have used.
</b>
<p>
    We implemented loop subdivision using the suggested method on the spec. We first precalculate the positions of all the new vertices we will be creating using neighbor-based heuristics, then subdivide each triangle from 1 to 4 and reassign the new vertex positions using the precalculated ones. To subdivide the mesh we start by splitting every edge in the mesh thats not on the boundary, then flipping all edges that are between a new vertec and a vertex that existed in the old mesh. Once the new positions are reassigned the mesh has been smoothed out and has a higher polygon count.
	<br>
	As we fiddled around the code, we debugged by isolating each step in the process using print statements to quickly hone in on the problem.

</p>
<br>


<b>
  Take some notes, as well as some screenshots, of your observations on how meshes behave after loop subdivision. What happens to sharp corners and edges? Can you reduce this effect by pre-splitting some edges?
</b>
<p>
    Sharp corners/edges are softened and smoothed over after successive loop subdivision. If we want to reduce this smoothing effect, we can increase the density of triangles in the region by presplitting local edges. This way, the subdivision won't be able to treat the edge equally to other faces.

  Load dae/cube.dae. Perform several iterations of loop subdivision on the cube. Notice that the cube becomes slightly asymmetric after repeated subdivisions. Can you pre-process the cube with edge flips and splits so that the cube subdivides symmetrically? Document these effects and explain why they occur. Also explain how your pre-processing helps alleviate the effects.
</b>
<p>
    In order to make the cube symmetric, every face on the cube can have its diagonal split to have a cross, that way the original mesh is symmetric.

<b>
    If you have implemented any extra credit extensions, explain what you did and document how they work with screenshots.
</b>
<p>
    We implemented boundary support for the mesh operations. On top of the edge splits on boundary edges for task 5, this requires handling the weighting of new and old vertices that are on the boundary.
	New vertices are weighted as the average of the two adjacent boundary vertices, and old vertices are weighted as 1/8 of the two adjacent boundary vertices, and 3/4 its current position.
	This weighting ensures the boundary edges stay where they were originally defined, but are smoothed by the loop subdivision.

<b>
    Describe what you have done to enhance your mesh beyond the simple humanoid mesh described in the tutorial.
</b>
<p>
    As we experimented with Blender and its controls, we found a way to make tree-like or coral-like structures by extruding faces from the base cube to create branches and then modifying the edges to make “curves.” Putting the model into the project and running subdivision smoothed out the branches and turned them into actual curves. We then took the idea and created this model that has a lot of branches and resembles a starfish or a nerve cell.
